## What & Where to Learn - Web Development Roadmap in 2020

### Before you begin with the Roadmap
- I am sharing a roadmap for learning web-development starting from the absolute beginner stage
- This is not the only way you can become a web developer. You don't have to follow the exact sequence of learning these technologies.
- You can of course mix and match according to your preference.
- I am sharing the courses or tutorials that I found helpful in learning the various web technologies.
- And most importantly, the course creators or instructors haven't paid me to talk about their courses.
- The courses that I am sharing here are for learning `MERN stack` [MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js].

## Let's Begin

The typical roadmap for learning all the technologies for becoming a decent MERN stack web developer would be something like the following 👇

### 🖥️ Front-End technologies: 
> 
- Html
- CSS
 - CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.
 - Preprocessor libraries like SASS etc.
- Responsive Web Design
- Javascript
 - DOM manipulation
 - ES6 features in-depth
- React, Vue or Angular
 - Design frameworks line Material UI etc.
 - Packages like Redux etc.

### 🛠️ Back-End technologies: 
> 
- Node.js
- Express.js
 - REST API with Express.js
 - Authentication in Backend
- Git and Github for version control
- MongoDB
 - Mongoose.js

### 📱 Mobile development technologies:
>- React Native or Flutter

## Courses for learning these awesome technologies
When I started to learn I didn't felt very comfortable reading the documentation for learning something. So I went for online tutorials.
These courses gave me a headstart. And after several months [more like a year and a half] learning these things, I can say that I'm comfortable now to learn a new technology on my own, following written tutorials and documentation.

### For knowing about all the technologies in a single course you can go for the following course. 👉
 - [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?referralCode=F2958B9D9447BDFC8244)
```
But keep in mind this won't give you in-depth 
knowledge of these technologies. After this course, 
you'll be comfortable working with these 
technologies, and then you have to continue for more 
advanced knowledge.

Again I'm saying, none of the instructors of the mentioned courses sponsored me to write about their courses.
I am sharing these because some of these courses helped me a lot to learn about web development and I'm very grateful to these awesome people for making these tutorials.

Show some love if you like my blogs.
